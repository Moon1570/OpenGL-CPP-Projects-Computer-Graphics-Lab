  1. F1 - rotate about positive x-axis
  2. F2 - rotate about negative x-axis
  3. F3 - rotate about positive y-axis
  4. F4 - rotate about negative y-axis
  5. F3 - rotate about positive z-axis
  6. F4 - rotate about negative z-axis
  7. Up, Right, Left, down, F6, and F7 keys to translate the shapes
  8. Page UP & DOWN for scaling up and down respectively about x axis
  9. Page HOME & F12 for scaling up and down respectively about y axis
